# AOC-2021

Solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

I'm solving this in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) again because it was
so much fun last year.

No attempt at nicely packaging this will be made.  If you want to run the
solutions you can use the Racket CLI.  All paths are relative, so make sure
you're in the path for the script.
